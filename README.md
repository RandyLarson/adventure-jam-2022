## Adventure-jam-2022

An [itch-hosted jam joint](https://itch.io/jam/adventure-jam-2022).


Your kitty is sucked into an alternate 'verse. Can you quell their fears and bring them home?

This an Adventure Jam 2022 project and submission. Our team of 4 came together a couple days before the jam. We had our first meeting Jam launch evening where we rolled ideas around until we came to the roughed out image of what would be KittyVerse. As all good projects start, we thought that we had our ambitions entirely in-check, famous last words. The original idea was 3 levels, a couple puzzles per level. The imagery of each theme were to progress into different genres. It is a great idea. It is terribly too big for a 2-week Jam sprint. Our submission is 1 nice level with 4 puzzles.

We hope you enjoy the outcome of these two week of work.

Technically details

We used Unity as our game development platform. I used a starter project that I've used in the past. Thankfully the Jam allows for this sort of asset usage. This project provided enough duct work to build off of. That included the basics of the top-level UI screens (start, options, about, and so forth) as well as level loading and game preferences. We didn't get to the point of loading a 'next' level.

The majority of the game specific assets were built by us during these two weeks. The art, music, UI elements and so forth are the output of a team of folks working hard to produce some pretty high quality results.
